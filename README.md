spring-ex06-validation
======================

This example builds on spring-ex06-validation, where we added validation through javax, hibernate, and spring.  The display pages were also updated to display error messages.  In this example, Thymeleaf templates are used and a Bootstrap theme, SB-Admin-V2, is integrated into the example.

This example has been validated with the following environment on MS Windows 7:

1. Eclipse Kepler
   1.1 Spring Tool Suite (STS) 3.4.0.RELEASE - for Kepler
2. Java SDK 1.7.0_51 (separate install)
3. Tomcat 7.0.50 (separate install)
4. Maven 3.0.5 (separate install)
5. MySQL 5.5.29
